Euler is a terminal coding agent: a downstream distribution of the [Euler agent harness](https://github.com/earendil-works/euler) with its own branding, config root (`~/.euler/agent`), transparent system prompt, zero telemetry, and built-in free web access. See the [repository README](https://github.com/euler-agent/euler) for the distribution-level overview.

---

Euler is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt euler to your workflows, not the other way around, without having to fork and modify euler internals. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Euler Packages](#euler-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.

Euler ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask euler to build what you want or install a third party euler package that matches your workflow.

Euler runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts euler-agent
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. Euler does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
euler
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
euler
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to euler. By default, euler gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [euler packages](#euler-packages).

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, euler maintains a list of tool-capable models. Configured provider catalogs refresh automatically; run `euler update --models` to force an immediate refresh. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L). Press Ctrl+S in the model picker to save the highlighted model as the startup default.

**Subscriptions:**
- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max
- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)
- GitHub Copilot

**API keys:**
- Anthropic
- Ant Ling
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- DeepSeek
- NVIDIA NIM
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock
- Mistral
- Groq
- Cerebras
- Cloudflare AI Gateway
- Cloudflare Workers AI
- xAI
- OpenRouter
- Vercel AI Gateway
- ZAI Coding Plan (Global)
- ZAI Coding Plan (China)
- OpenCode Zen
- OpenCode Go

- Fireworks
- Together AI
- Baseten
- Kimi For Coding
- MiniMax
- Xiaomi MiMo
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (China)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Amsterdam)
- Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan (Singapore)

Euler also supports the llama.cpp router server. Configure it with `/login llama.cpp`, manage downloads and loaded models with `/llama`, then select a loaded model with `/model`. See [docs/llama-cpp.md](docs/llama-cpp.md) for setup and usage.

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for other provider setup instructions.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.euler/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage (`↑` input, `↓` output, `R` cache read, `W` cache write, `CH` latest cache hit rate), cost, context usage, current model. Totals include assistant responses, usage reported by tools, and summary generation.

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| External editor | Ctrl+G opens `externalEditor`, `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, Notepad on Windows, or `nano` elsewhere |
| Clipboard | Ctrl+V to paste an image or text (Alt+V on Windows), or drag images onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | Manage provider credentials |
| [`/llama`](docs/llama-cpp.md) | Download, load, and unload llama.cpp router models |
| `/model` | Switch models; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/thinking` | Switch thinking level; Ctrl+S in the picker saves the startup default |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Theme, message delivery, transport, and other preferences |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions (restart required) |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML or JSONL file |
| `/import <file>` | Import and resume a session from a JSONL file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit euler |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.euler/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |
| Ctrl+X | Copy the last assistant message; with fullscreen copy-on-select disabled, copy the active text selection |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so euler can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session-format.md](docs/session-format.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `~/.euler/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
euler -c                  # Continue most recent session
euler -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
euler --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
euler --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
euler --session <path|id> # Use specific session file or ID
euler --fork <path|id>    # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session ID before reusing it with `--session <id>` or `--fork <id>`.

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Ctrl+X to copy the selected message
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from a previous user message on the active branch. Opens a selector, copies the active path up to that point, and places the selected prompt in the editor for modification.

**`/clone`** - Duplicate the current active branch into a new session file at the current position. The new session keeps the full active-path history and opens with an empty editor.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.euler/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.euler/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, euler asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.euler/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows euler to load `.euler/settings.json` and `.euler` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, euler loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.euler/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`euler config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `euler update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.euler/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart euler for changes to take effect.

### Update checks and privacy

Euler has no install or usage telemetry. The only routine startup network operation is an identify-free update check:

- **Update check:** fetches public GitHub Release metadata (no device ID, session ID, user, path, or model information) to check whether a newer Euler version exists. Disable it with `EULER_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`; a failed check never blocks startup.

Use `--offline` or `EULER_OFFLINE=1` to disable all startup network operations, including update checks and package update checks.

---

## Context Files

Euler loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.euler/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

If a directory contains `AGENTS.override.md`, Euler loads it instead of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from that directory. Context files from other directories are still concatenated.

Use for project instructions (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.euler/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.euler/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.euler/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.euler/agent/prompts/`, `.euler/prompts/`, or a [euler package](#euler-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.euler/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `~/.euler/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.euler/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [euler package](#euler-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend euler with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (euler: ExtensionAPI) {
  euler.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  euler.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  euler.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. euler waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `euler.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make euler look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.euler/agent/extensions/`, `.euler/extensions/`, or a [euler package](#euler-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and euler immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.euler/agent/themes/`, `.euler/themes/`, or a [euler package](#euler-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Euler Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1457744485428629628).

> **Security:** Euler packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
euler install npm:@foo/euler-tools
euler install npm:@foo/euler-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
euler install git:github.com/user/repo
euler install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
euler install git:git@github.com:user/repo
euler install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
euler install https://github.com/user/repo
euler install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
euler install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
euler install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
euler remove npm:@foo/euler-tools
euler uninstall npm:@foo/euler-tools          # alias for remove
euler list
euler update                               # update euler only
euler update --all                         # update euler and packages
euler update --extensions                  # update packages only
euler update --models                      # refresh model catalogs only
euler update --self                        # update euler only
euler update --self --force                # reinstall euler even if current
euler update npm:@foo/euler-tools             # update one package
euler config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.euler/agent/git/` (git) or `~/.euler/agent/npm/` (npm). Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.euler/git/`, `.euler/npm/`). Git `@ref` values are pinned tags or commits; pinned packages are skipped by `euler update --extensions` and `euler update --all`, so use `euler install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to move an existing package to a new ref. Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding a `euler` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-pi-package",
  "keywords": ["euler-package"],
  "euler": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `euler` manifest, euler auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

---

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, ModelRuntime, SessionManager } from "euler-agent";

const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create();
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  modelRuntime,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
euler --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

Euler is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [euler packages](#euler-packages). This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape euler to fit how you work.

**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support. [Why?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)

**No sub-agents.** There's many ways to do this. Spawn euler instances via tmux, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package that does it your way.

**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.

**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).

**No background bash.** Use tmux. Full observability, direct interaction.

Read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) for the full rationale.

## CLI Reference

```bash
euler [options] [--] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
euler install <source> [-l]     # Install package, -l for project-local
euler remove <source> [-l]      # Remove package
euler uninstall <source> [-l]   # Alias for remove
euler update [source|self|euler]   # Update euler only, or one package source
euler update --all              # Update euler and packages
euler update --extensions       # Update packages only
euler update --models           # Refresh model catalogs only
euler update --self             # Update euler only
euler update --self --force     # Reinstall euler even if current
euler update --extension <src>  # Update one package
euler list                      # List installed packages
euler config                    # Enable/disable package resources
```

`euler config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `euler update` never prompts for project trust.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AI_AGENT` | Set to `euler` by the CLI and RPC entry points so generic tooling can attribute child processes to Euler |
| `EULER_CODING_AGENT` | Set to `true` by the CLI and RPC entry points so child processes can detect that they run inside Euler |
| `EULER_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override config directory (default: `~/.euler/agent`) |
| `EULER_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Override session storage directory (overridden by `--session-dir`) |
| `EULER_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override package directory (useful for Nix/Guix where store paths tokenize poorly) |
| `EULER_OFFLINE` | Disable startup network operations, including update checks and package update checks |
| `EULER_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Skip the Euler version update check at startup |
| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` for extended prompt cache (Anthropic: 1h, OpenAI: 24h); upstream provider-runtime variable |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | Fallback external editor for Ctrl+G when `externalEditor` is unset; defaults to Notepad on Windows and `nano` elsewhere |

Commands run by the LLM-callable `bash` and `powershell` tools also receive current session metadata:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `EULER_SESSION_ID` | Current session ID |
| `EULER_SESSION_FILE` | Absolute session JSONL path; unset for ephemeral sessions |
| `EULER_PROVIDER` | Currently selected model provider |
| `EULER_MODEL` | Currently selected model ID |
| `EULER_REASONING_LEVEL` | Current effective reasoning level |

These values are resolved when each command starts. See [Environment Variables](docs/environment-variables.md#shell-tool-session-environment) for semantics, examples, and custom-tool opt-out.

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **OAuth Login Status Indicator**: The `/login` provider selector now shows "✓ logged in" next to providers where you're already authenticated. This makes it clear at a glance whether you're using your Claude Pro/Max subscription. ([#88](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/88) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))
- **Subscription Cost Indicator**: The footer now shows "(sub)" next to the cost when using an OAuth subscription (e.g., `$0.123 (sub)`). This makes it visible without needing `/login` that you're using your Claude Pro/Max subscription.

## [0.11.5] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **Custom Slash Commands**: Define reusable prompt templates as Markdown files. Place files in `~/.pi/agent/commands/` (global) or `.pi/commands/` (project-specific). Commands appear in `/` autocomplete with source indicators like `(user)` or `(project)`. Supports bash-style arguments (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`) with quote-aware parsing. Subdirectories create namespaced commands (e.g., `.pi/commands/frontend/component.md` shows as `(project:frontend)`). Optional `description` field in YAML frontmatter. Works from CLI as well (`pi -p "/review"`). ([#86](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/86))

## [0.11.4] - 2025-12-01

### Improved

- **TUI Crash Diagnostics**: When a render error occurs (line exceeds terminal width), all rendered lines are now written to `~/.pi/agent/pi-crash.log` with their indices and visible widths for easier debugging.

### Fixed

- **Session Selector Crash with Wide Characters**: Fixed crash when running `pi -r` to resume sessions containing emojis, CJK characters, or other wide Unicode characters. The session list was using character count instead of visible terminal width for truncation, causing lines to exceed terminal width. Added `truncateToWidth()` utility that properly handles ANSI codes and wide characters. ([#85](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/85))

## [0.11.3] - 2025-12-01

### Added

- **Circular Menu Navigation**: All menus (model selector, message history, file picker) now wrap around when navigating past the first or last item. Pressing up at the top jumps to the bottom, and pressing down at the bottom jumps to the top. ([#82](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/82) by [@butelo](https://github.com/butelo))

### Fixed

- **RPC Mode Session Management**: Fixed session files not being saved in RPC mode (`--mode rpc`). Since version 0.9.0, the `agent.subscribe()` call with session management logic was only present in the TUI renderer, causing RPC mode to skip saving messages to session files. RPC mode now properly saves sessions just like interactive mode. ([#83](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/83))

## [0.11.1] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **`--export` CLI Flag**: Export session files to self-contained HTML files from the command line. Auto-detects format (session manager format or streaming event format). Usage: `pi --export session.jsonl` or `pi --export session.jsonl output.html`. Note: Streaming event logs (from `--mode json`) don't contain system prompt or tool definitions, so those sections are omitted with a notice in the HTML. ([#80](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/80))

- **Git Branch File Watcher**: Footer now auto-updates when the git branch changes externally (e.g., running `git checkout` in another terminal). Watches `.git/HEAD` for changes and refreshes the branch display automatically. ([#79](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/79) by [@fightbulc](https://github.com/fightbulc))

- **Read-Only Exploration Tools**: Added `grep`, `find`, and `ls` tools for safe code exploration without modification risk. These tools are available via the new `--tools` flag.
  - `grep`: Uses `ripgrep` (auto-downloaded) for fast regex searching. Respects `.gitignore` (including nested), supports glob filtering, context lines, and hidden files.
  - `find`: Uses `fd` (auto-downloaded) for fast file finding. Respects `.gitignore`, supports glob patterns, and hidden files.
  - `ls`: Lists directory contents with proper sorting and indicators.
- **`--tools` Flag**: New CLI flag to specify available tools (e.g., `--tools read,grep,find,ls` for read-only mode). Default behavior remains unchanged (`read,bash,edit,write`).
- **Dynamic System Prompt**: The system prompt now adapts to the selected tools, showing relevant guidelines and warnings (e.g., "READ-ONLY mode" when write tools are disabled).

### Fixed

- **Prompt Restoration on API Key Error**: When submitting a message fails due to missing API key, the prompt is now restored to the editor instead of being lost. ([#77](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/77))
- **File `@` Autocomplete Performance**: Fixed severe UI jank when using `@` for file attachment in large repositories. The file picker now uses `fd` (a fast file finder) instead of synchronous directory walking with minimatch. On a 55k file repo, search time dropped from ~900ms to ~10ms per keystroke. If `fd` is not installed, it will be automatically downloaded to `~/.pi/agent/tools/` on first use. ([#69](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/69))
- **File Selector Styling**: Selected items in file autocomplete (`@` and Tab) now use consistent accent color for the entire line instead of mixed colors.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-11-27

### Changed

- **HTML Export Prefix**: Exported session files now use `pi-session-` prefix (e.g., `pi-session-2025-11-13T12-27-53-866Z_xxx.html`) for easier `.gitignore` filtering ([#72](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/72))
- **Native Model Identity**: Removed "You are actually not Claude, you are Pi" from system prompt, allowing models to use their native identity ([#73](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/73))

## [0.10.1] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **CLI File Arguments (`@file`)**: Include files in your initial message using the `@` prefix (e.g., `pi @prompt.md @image.png "Do this"`). All `@file` arguments are combined into the first message. Text files are wrapped in `<file name="path">content</file>` tags. Images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are attached as base64-encoded attachments. Supports `~` expansion, relative/absolute paths. Empty files are skipped. Works in interactive, `--print`, and `--mode text/json` modes. Not supported in `--mode rpc`. ([#54](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/54))

### Fixed

- **Editor Cursor Navigation**: Fixed broken up/down arrow key navigation in the editor when lines wrap. Previously, pressing up/down would move between logical lines instead of visual (wrapped) lines, causing the cursor to jump unexpectedly. Now cursor navigation is based on rendered lines. Also fixed a bug where the cursor would appear on two lines simultaneously when positioned at a wrap boundary. Added word by word navigation via Option+Left/Right or Ctrl+Left/Right. ([#61](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/61))
- **Edit Diff Line Number Alignment**: Fixed two issues with diff display in the edit tool:
  1. Line numbers were incorrect for edits far from the start of a file (e.g., showing 1, 2, 3 instead of 336, 337, 338). The skip count for context lines was being added after displaying lines instead of before.
  2. When diff lines wrapped due to terminal width, the line number prefix lost its leading space alignment, and code indentation (spaces/tabs after line numbers) was lost. Rewrote `splitIntoTokensWithAnsi` in `pi-tui` to preserve whitespace as separate tokens instead of discarding it, so wrapped lines maintain proper alignment and indentation.

### Improved

- **Git Branch Display**: Footer now shows the active git branch after the directory path (e.g., `~/project (main)`). Branch is detected by reading `.git/HEAD` directly (fast, synchronous). Cache is refreshed after each assistant message to detect branch changes from git commands executed by the agent. ([#55](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/55))
- **HTML Export**: Added timestamps to each message, fixed text clipping with proper word-wrapping CSS, improved font selection (`ui-monospace`, `Cascadia Code`, `Source Code Pro`), reduced font sizes for more compact display (12px base), added model switch indicators in conversation timeline, created dedicated Tokens & Cost section with cumulative statistics (input/output/cache tokens, cost breakdown by type), added context usage display showing token count and percentage for the last model used, and now displays all models used during the session. ([#51](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/51), [#52](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/52))

## [0.10.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **Fuzzy File Search (`@`)**: Type `@` followed by a search term to fuzzy-search files and folders across your project. Respects `.gitignore` and skips hidden files. Directories are prioritized in results. Based on [PR #60](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/60) by [@fightbulc](https://github.com/fightbulc), reimplemented with pure Node.js for fast, dependency-free searching.

### Fixed

- **Emoji Text Wrapping Crash**: Fixed crash when rendering text containing emojis (e.g., 😂) followed by long content like URLs. The `breakLongWord` function in `pi-tui` was iterating over UTF-16 code units instead of grapheme clusters, causing emojis (which are surrogate pairs) to be miscounted during line wrapping. Now uses `Intl.Segmenter` to properly handle multi-codepoint characters.
- **Footer Cost Display**: Added `$` prefix to cost display in footer. Now shows `$0.078` instead of `0.078`. ([#53](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/53))

## [0.9.3] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- Added Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 support

## [0.9.2] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed

- **Edit Tool Dollar Sign Bug**: Fixed critical bug in the `edit` tool where `String.replace()` was interpreting `$` as a special replacement pattern (e.g., `$$`, `$&`, `$'`). When trying to insert `$` into code (like adding a dollar sign to a template literal), the replacement would silently fail and produce unchanged content, but the tool would incorrectly report success. Now uses `indexOf` + `substring` for raw string replacement without special character interpretation. Also added verification that content actually changed, rejecting with a clear error if the replacement produces identical content. ([#53](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/53))

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added

- **`/clear` Command**: New slash command to reset the conversation context and start a fresh session. Aborts any in-flight agent work, clears all messages, and creates a new session file. ([#48](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/48))
- **Model Cycling with Thinking Levels**: The `--models` flag now supports thinking level syntax (e.g., `--models sonnet:high,haiku:low`). When cycling models with `Ctrl+P`, the associated thinking level is automatically applied. The first model in the scope is used as the initial model when starting a new session. Both model and thinking level changes are now saved to session and settings for persistence. ([#47](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/47))
- **`--thinking` Flag**: New CLI flag to set thinking level directly (e.g., `--thinking high`). Valid values: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`. Takes highest priority over all other thinking level sources. ([#45](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/45))

### Breaking

- **Interactive Mode with Initial Prompt**: Passing a prompt on the command line (e.g., `pi "List files"`) now starts interactive mode with the prompt pre-submitted, instead of exiting after completion. Use `--print` or `-p` to get the previous non-interactive behavior (e.g., `pi -p "List files"`). This matches Claude CLI (`-p`) and Codex (`exec`) behavior. ([#46](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/46))

### Fixed

- **Slash Command Autocomplete**: Fixed issue where pressing Enter on a highlighted slash command suggestion (e.g., typing `/mod` with `/model` highlighted) would submit the partial text instead of executing the selected command. Now Enter applies the completion and submits in one action. ([#49](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/49))
- **Model Matching Priority**: The `--models` flag now prioritizes exact matches over partial matches. Supports `provider/modelId` format (e.g., `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.1-codex`) for precise selection. Exact ID matches are tried before partial matching, so `--models gpt-5.1-codex` correctly selects `gpt-5.1-codex` instead of `openai/gpt-5.1-codex-mini`.
- **Markdown Link Rendering**: Fixed links with identical text and href (e.g., `https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/48/files`) being rendered twice. Now correctly compares raw text instead of styled text (which contains ANSI codes) when determining if link text matches href.

## [0.8.5] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed

- **Path Completion Hanging**: Fixed catastrophic regex backtracking in path completion that caused the terminal to hang when text contained many `/` characters (e.g., URLs). Replaced complex regex with simple string operations. ([#18](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/18))
- **Autocomplete Arrow Keys**: Fixed issue where arrow keys would move both the autocomplete selection and the editor cursor simultaneously when the file selector list was shown.

## [0.8.4] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed

- **Read Tool Error Handling**: Fixed issue where the `read` tool would return errors as successful text content instead of throwing. Now properly throws errors for file not found and offset out of bounds conditions.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-11-21

### Improved

- **Export HTML**: Limited container width to 700px for better readability. Fixed message statistics to match `/session` command output with proper breakdown of User/Assistant/Tool Calls/Tool Results/Total messages.
- **Dark Theme**: Increased visibility of editor border (darkGray from #303030 to #505050) and thinking minimal indicator (from #4e4e4e to #6e6e6e).

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-21

### Added

- **Theme System**: Full theming support with 44 customizable color tokens. Two built-in themes (`dark`, `light`) with auto-detection based on terminal background. Use `/theme` command to select themes interactively. Custom themes in `~/.pi/agent/themes/*.json` support live editing - changes apply immediately when the file is saved. Themes use RGB hex values for consistent rendering across terminals. VS Code users: set `terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio` to `1` for proper color rendering. See [Theme Documentation](docs/theme.md) for details.

## [0.7.29] - 2025-11-20

### Improved

- **Read Tool Display**: When the `read` tool is called with offset/limit parameters, the tool execution now displays the line range in a compact format (e.g., `read src/main.ts:100-200` for offset=100, limit=100).

## [0.7.28] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- **Message Queuing**: You can now send multiple messages while the agent is processing without waiting for the previous response to complete. Messages submitted during streaming are queued and processed based on your queue mode setting. Queued messages are shown in a pending area below the chat. Press Escape to abort and restore all queued messages to the editor. Use `/queue` to select between "one-at-a-time" (process queued messages sequentially, recommended) or "all" (process all queued messages at once). The queue mode setting is saved and persists across sessions. ([#15](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/15))

## [0.7.27] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed

- **Slash Command Submission**: Fixed issue where slash commands required two Enter presses to execute. Now pressing Enter on a slash command autocomplete suggestion immediately submits the command, while Tab still applies the completion for adding arguments. ([#30](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/30))
- **Slash Command Autocomplete**: Fixed issue where typing a typo then correcting it would not show autocomplete suggestions. Autocomplete now re-triggers when typing or backspacing in a slash command context. ([#29](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/29))

## [0.7.26] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- **Tool Output Expansion**: Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle between collapsed and expanded tool output display. Expands all tool call outputs (bash, read, write, etc.) to show full content instead of truncated previews. ([#31](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/31))
- **Custom Headers**: Added support for custom HTTP headers in `models.json` configuration. Headers can be specified at both provider and model level, with model-level headers overriding provider-level ones. This enables bypassing Cloudflare bot detection and other proxy requirements. ([#39](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/39))

### Fixed

- **Chutes AI Provider**: Fixed 400 errors when using Chutes AI provider. Added compatibility fixes for `store` field exclusion, `max_tokens` parameter usage, and system prompt role handling. ([#42](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/42) by [@butelo](https://github.com/butelo))
- **Mistral/Chutes Syntax Error**: Fixed syntax error in merged PR that used `iif` instead of `if`.
- **Anthropic OAuth Bug**: Fixed bug where `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = undefined` set the env var to string "undefined" instead of deleting it. Now uses `delete` operator.

## [0.7.25] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- **Model Cycling**: Press `Ctrl+P` to quickly cycle through models. Use `--models` CLI argument to scope to specific models (e.g., `--models claude-sonnet,gpt-4o`). Supports pattern matching and smart version selection (prefers aliases over dated versions). ([#37](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/37) by [@fightbulc](https://github.com/fightbulc))

## [0.7.24] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- **Thinking Level Cycling**: Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through thinking levels (off → minimal → low → medium → high) for reasoning-capable models. Editor border color changes to indicate current level (gray → blue → cyan → magenta). ([#36](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/36) by [@fightbulc](https://github.com/fightbulc))

## [0.7.23] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- **Update Notifications**: Interactive mode now checks for new versions on startup and displays a notification if an update is available.

### Changed

- **System Prompt**: Updated system prompt to instruct agent to output plain text summaries directly instead of using cat or bash commands to display what it did.

### Fixed

- **File Path Completion**: Removed 10-file limit in tab completion selector. All matching files and directories now appear in the completion list.
- **Absolute Path Completion**: Fixed tab completion for absolute paths (e.g., `/Applications`). Absolute paths in the middle of text (like "hey /") now complete correctly. Also fixed crashes when trying to stat inaccessible files (like macOS `.VolumeIcon.icns`) during directory traversal.

## [0.7.22] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed

- **Long Line Wrapping**: Fixed crash when rendering long lines without spaces (e.g., file paths). Long words now break character-by-character to fit within terminal width.

## [0.7.21] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed

- **Terminal Flicker**: Fixed flicker at bottom of viewport (especially editor component) in xterm.js-based terminals (VS Code, etc.) by using per-line clear instead of clear-to-end sequence.
- **Background Color Rendering**: Fixed black cells appearing at end of wrapped lines when using background colors. Completely rewrote text wrapping and background application to properly handle ANSI reset codes.
- **Tool Output**: Strip ANSI codes from bash/tool output before rendering to prevent conflicts with TUI styling.

## [0.7.20] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed

- **Message Wrapping**: Fixed word-based text wrapping for long lines in chat messages. Text now properly wraps at word boundaries while preserving ANSI styling (colors, bold, italic, etc.) across wrapped lines. Background colors now extend to the full width of each line. Empty lines in messages now render correctly with full-width background.

## [0.7.18] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed

- **Bash Tool Error Handling**: Bash tool now properly throws errors for failed commands (non-zero exit codes), timeouts, and aborted executions. This ensures tool execution components display with red background when bash commands fail.
- **Thinking Traces Styling**: Thinking traces now maintain gray italic styling throughout, even when containing inline code blocks, bold text, or other inline formatting

## [0.7.17] - 2025-11-18

### Added

- **New Model**: Added `gemini-3-pro-preview` to Google provider.
- **OAuth Authentication**: Added `/login` and `/logout` commands for OAuth-based authentication with Claude Pro/Max subscriptions. Tokens are stored in `~/.pi/agent/oauth.json` with 0600 permissions and automatically refreshed when expired. OAuth tokens take priority over API keys for Anthropic models.

### Fixed

- **Anthropic Aborted Thinking**: Fixed error when resubmitting assistant messages with incomplete thinking blocks (from aborted streams). Thinking blocks without valid signatures are now converted to text blocks with `<thinking>` delimiters, preventing API rejection.
- **Model Selector Loading**: Fixed models not appearing in `/model` selector until user started typing. Models now load asynchronously and re-render when available.
- **Input Paste Support**: Added bracketed paste mode support to `Input` component, enabling paste of long OAuth authorization codes.

## [0.7.16] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Tool Error Display**: Fixed edit tool (and all other tools) not showing error state correctly in TUI. Failed tool executions now properly display with red background and show the error message. Previously, the `isError` flag from tool execution events was not being passed to the UI component, causing all tool results to show with green (success) background regardless of whether they succeeded or failed.

## [0.7.15] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Anthropic OAuth Support**: Added support for `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. The agent now checks for OAuth tokens before falling back to API keys for Anthropic models, enabling OAuth-based authentication.

## [0.7.14] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Mistral API Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility with Mistral API by excluding the `store` field and using `max_tokens` instead of `max_completion_tokens`, and avoiding the `developer` role in system prompts.
- **Error Display**: Fixed error message display in assistant messages to include proper spacing before the error text.
- **Message Streaming**: Fixed missing `message_start` event when no partial message chunks were received during streaming.

## [0.7.13] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **TUI Editor**: Fixed unicode input support for umlauts (äöü), emojis (😀), and other extended characters. Previously the editor only accepted ASCII characters (32-126). Now properly handles all printable unicode while still filtering out control characters. ([#20](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/20))

## [0.7.12] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Custom Models and Providers**: Support for custom models and providers via `~/.pi/agent/models.json` configuration file. Add local models (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) or any OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, or Google-compatible API. File is reloaded on every `/model` selector open, allowing live updates without restart. ([#21](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/21))
- Added `gpt-5.1-codex` model to OpenAI provider (400k context, 128k max output, reasoning-capable).

### Changed

- **Breaking**: No longer hardcodes Anthropic/Claude as default provider/model. Now prefers sensible defaults per provider (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5` for Anthropic, `gpt-5.1-codex` for OpenAI), or requires explicit selection in interactive mode.
- Interactive mode now allows starting without a model, showing helpful error on message submission instead of failing at startup.
- Non-interactive mode (CLI messages, JSON, RPC) still fails early if no model or API key is available.
- Model selector now saves selected model as default in settings.json.
- `models.json` validation errors (syntax + schema) now surface with precise file/field info in both CLI and `/model` selector.
- Agent system prompt now includes absolute path to its own README.md for self-documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed crash when restoring a session with a custom model that no longer exists or lost credentials. Now gracefully falls back to default model, logs the reason, and appends a warning message to the restored chat.
- Footer no longer crashes when no model is selected.

## [0.7.11] - 2025-11-16

### Changed

- The `/model` selector now filters models based on available API keys. Only models for which API keys are configured in environment variables are shown. This prevents selecting models that would fail due to missing credentials. A yellow hint is displayed at the top of the selector explaining this behavior. ([#19](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/19))

## [0.7.10] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- `/branch` command for creating conversation branches. Opens a selector showing all user messages in chronological order. Selecting a message creates a new session with all messages before the selected one, and places the selected message in the editor for modification or resubmission. This allows exploring alternative conversation paths without losing the current session. (fixes [#16](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/16))

## [0.7.9] - 2025-11-14

### Changed

- Editor: updated keyboard shortcuts to follow Unix conventions:
  - **Ctrl+W** deletes the previous word (stopping at whitespace or punctuation)
  - **Ctrl+U** deletes from cursor to start of line (at line start, merges with previous line)
  - **Ctrl+K** deletes from cursor to end of line (at line end, merges with next line)
  - **Option+Backspace** in Ghostty now behaves like **Ctrl+W** (delete word backwards)
  - **Cmd+Backspace** in Ghostty now behaves like **Ctrl+U** (delete to start of line)

## [0.7.8] - 2025-11-13

### Changed

- Updated README.md with `/changelog` slash command documentation

## [0.7.7] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- Automatic changelog display on startup in interactive mode. When starting a new session (not continuing/resuming), the agent will display all changelog entries since the last version you used. The last shown version is tracked in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- `/changelog` command to display the changelog in the TUI
- OpenRouter Auto Router model support ([#5](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/5))
- Windows Git Bash support with automatic detection and process tree termination ([#1](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1))

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed project context file from `AGENT.md` to `AGENTS.md`. The system now looks for `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` (with `AGENTS.md` preferred). Existing `AGENT.md` files will need to be renamed to `AGENTS.md` to continue working. (fixes [#9](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/9))
- **BREAKING**: Session file format changed to store provider and model ID separately instead of as a single `provider/modelId` string. Existing sessions will not restore the model correctly when resumed - you'll need to manually set the model again using `/model`. (fixes [#4](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4))
- Improved Windows Git Bash detection logic with better error messages showing actual paths searched ([#13](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/13))

### Fixed

- Fixed markdown list rendering bug where bullets were not displayed when list items contained inline code with cyan color formatting
- Fixed context percentage showing 0% in footer when last assistant message was aborted ([#12](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/12))
- Fixed error message loss when `turn_end` event contains an error. Previously, errors in `turn_end` events (e.g., "Provider returned error" from OpenRouter Auto Router) were not captured in `agent.state.error`, making it appear as if the agent completed successfully. ([#6](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/6))

## [0.7.6] - 2025-11-13

Previous releases did not maintain a changelog.
